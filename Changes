Revision history for Perl extension Pod::Site.

0.50  2010-04-12T21:08:39
      - Changed name from Pod::Browser and pod_browser to Pod::Site and
        podsite.
      - Completely rewritten using pure CSS and JavaScript/jQuery solution, as
        well as reliance on more recent versions of Pod::Simple that have been
        updated to support the thigns we needed. The previous unreleased
        versions are hardly worth noting anymore.

0.30  [Unreleased]
      - Added --app-name to the docs & make it required. Patch from Dave
        Rolsky.
      - Added --css-path, --js-path, & --img-path, which all default to the
        current hard-coded options. The last one doesn't do anything yet,
        since there's no processing of the css file. Patch from Dave Rolsky.
      - Added --example-module. Patch from Dave Rolsky.
      - Added call to mkpath($doc_root) before trying to write to it. Patch
        from Dave Rolsky.
      - No longer tries to generate docs for bin/ unless it exists. Patch
        from Dave Rolsky.
      - Don't look in blib/. Patch from Dave Rolsky.
      - Fixed code that prevented classes with the same base file name from
        being included in the output.
      - Switched from Mason-based to JavaScript based. Added --base-uri to
        specify the base URI for the browser.
      - Switched to using Pod::Simple::XHTML, distributed with Pod::Simple
        3.06, and no longer requiring a patch.

0.20  [Unreleased]
      - Initial version.
