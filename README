Pod::Site
=========

Build browsable HTML documentation for your app

Description
-----------

This program searches a list of directories and generates a [jQuery]-powered
documentation site from all of the POD files it finds. It was originally
designed for the [Bricolage] project but is has evolved for general use. Have
a look at the [Bricolage API Browser] to see a sample documentation site in
action. The generated documentation site supports Safari, Firefox, and IE7 and
up.
