Pod::Site
=========

Build browsable HTML documentation for your app

Description
-----------

This program searches the lib and bin directories of an application source
code root and generates a jQuery-powered documentation browser from all of the
Perl modules and scripts that contain POD. It was originally designed for the
[Bricolage][] project but is has evolved for general use. Have a look at the
[Bricolage API][] to see a sample documentation browser in action.
